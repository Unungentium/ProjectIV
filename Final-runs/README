/LHCB - contains the data and plots comparing the simulation to the LHCB paper
primary particles - contains the simulations of primary particles and the resultant 1 1s0 state. Maybe compare it to the rough "just ground state production" to show the effects of each excited state on the meson?

All together shows the sum total particle production with the Bc meson. can't use that one to compare particle by particle as this one contains all of the particles.

note - need to keep track of the potentials. for now, Cornell seems to show the most promising results, though will need to find some good papers with referencing as atm i am drawing resources from like 3 papers. the paper at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5563.pdf seems to have all the required states and the wave functions so will have a gander there.
